# ðŸŽ¬ Top 50 Films Web Scraping Project

## Overview

This repository contains a hands-on lab project focused on web scraping and data extraction using Python. The goal is to extract information about the **Top 50 Most Highly-Ranked Films** from a curated list based on five major sources: Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, AFI, Empire, and Sight & Sound.

The project demonstrates how to:
- Analyze HTML structure
- Extract structured data using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- Save the data to both a CSV file and a SQLite database

---

## ðŸ”— Data Source

The film rankings are sourced from the archived webpage:  
[100 Most Highly-Ranked Films](https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185655/https://en.everybodywiki.com/100_Most_Highly-Ranked_Films)

This list aggregates rankings from multiple expert and crowd-sourced sources to produce a composite score.

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Use `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract data from a webpage  
- Parse and analyze HTML to locate relevant movie information  
- Save the extracted data to:
  - A CSV file: `top_50_films.csv`
  - A SQLite database: `Movies.db` (table: `top_50`)

## ðŸ“„ Extracted Attributes

Each movie record includes:

| Attribute | Description              |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Rank     | Position in the top 50   |
| Film     | Movie title              |
