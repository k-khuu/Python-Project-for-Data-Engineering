# 🛠️ Python Project for Data Engineering

## Overview

This repository contains my completed project for the [Python Project for Data Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-engineering) course offered by Coursera. The course focuses on building foundational ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using Python, and this project demonstrates the practical application of those skills.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- ✅ Extract structured data from a public web source  
- ✅ Transform raw data into clean, analyzable formats  
- ✅ Load the final dataset into both a CSV file and a SQLite database  
- ✅ Run SQL queries to validate the pipeline  
- ✅ Log each step of the ETL process for traceability

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
├── etl_project_gdp.py          # Main ETL script
├── Countries_by_GDP.csv        # Output CSV file
├── World_Economies.db          # SQLite database
├── Countries_by_GDP.json       # Output JSON file
├── etl_project_log.txt         # Execution log
├── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup  
- Data cleaning and transformation with Pandas  
- Exception handling and logging  
- SQL integration using SQLite  
- Modular Python scripting for ETL workflows

## 📊 Output Example

The final dataset includes:

| Country        | GDP_USD_billion |
|----------------|------------------|
| United States  | 26854.60         |
| China          | 17700.00         |
| Japan          | 4937.00          |

Only countries with GDP > 100 billion USD are included in the final query output.
